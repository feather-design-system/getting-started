# feather-vue-cli-starter

## Setup

The following structure was generated using Vue CLI v5 with Jest, Typescript, SASS, ESlint and Prettier all enabled.  Please feel free to run the CLI with your preferred setup. 

We modified the `vue.config.js` to match our [Typescript](https://feather.nanthealth.com/Components/Typescript/#typechecking) recommendation.

We installed the necessary Feather DS to create a generic application layout with the navigation rail. Those components can all be found in the `src/components/` directory.

We added the theme import to the `main.ts` file and added the `.feather-styles` to the root element in `App.vue`.
